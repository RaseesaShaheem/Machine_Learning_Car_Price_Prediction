## Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project models car prices in the U.S. market using a dataset of vehicle attributes collected from market surveys. The goal is to identify which variables significantly influence price and to build predictive regression models that help management understand pricing dynamics for strategic decisions.

## Business Goal

Determine which variables significantly predict car price.

Quantify how well those variables explain price (model performance).

Provide a deployable Jupyter Notebook with reproducible preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, feature-importance analysis, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Components Implemented

- Loading & Preprocessing

- Model Evaluation

- Choose the best model

- Hyperparameter tuning for the best best model (Here it is Random Forest Regressor)
